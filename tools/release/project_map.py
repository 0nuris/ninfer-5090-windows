"""Derive a whole-project structural map from the codegraph index.

The gap this closes: the MCP surface exposes one tool, codegraph_explore, which answers a QUESTION by
returning the relevant symbols' source. It is a point query capped at maxFiles. Nothing aggregates the
index, so 94,762 edges and 1,466 files are reachable only one question at a time, and understanding
the project means re-deriving its shape by hand every session. A search for an off-the-shelf answer
turned up only commercial tools (CppDepend, JArchitect, Understand) whose own reviews concede they
"produce a visual mess", plus one MCP server of the right shape that is enterprise-priced.

So the map is built from the index that is already here. The index has no module, layer or package
table -- structure is only file_path -- so every aggregate below is derived rather than read, and
that derivation is stated rather than implied:

  module      the directory of a file, so src/ops/linear/fp8 and src/ops/attn are distinct modules
  file edge   an edge between two nodes, attributed to the file of its source, and collapsed to the
              module pair; a module pair is an edge only if some file pair is
  fan-in/out  distinct counterpart modules, which is the blast radius at module granularity

Two things are reported that a map cannot be trusted without: the index's own unresolved references,
concentrated by language, because a dependency edge the index could not resolve is a hole in the map;
and the control, which is the map computed against itself so a reader can tell a working tool from a
broken one.
